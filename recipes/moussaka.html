    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Do you like potatoes? Do you like meat? Do you like to pretend to like exotic fragrances so your European family members do not mock you for being a #NewWorldYuppie? Then Moussaka is the choice for you -- Enjoy this meaty layered dish garnished with visible potato slices and enjoy a judgement-free meal with your big fat European family.</p> 

    <p><strong>BEWARE</strong>: <em>Moussaka may induce severe symptoms of misspronunciation.</em> Most Western persons between the age of -9 months to 99 years, if they somehow decide to life that long, will have minor to severe difficulty breathing while phonetically iterating the name of this dish. To this day there has been no visible development on the possible cure, although some say Duolingo offers a course in a weird South-European language that may reduce the swelling.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 medium-sized potatoes if you're a body shamer, otherwise XS and XXL-potatoes are a perfectly acceptable choice
        <li>3 tbsp olive oil, but let's face it, you're gonna pour that bottle over the bowl spoonless like there's no tomorrow
        <li>1 red onion, but they prefer to be known as Native onions these days 
        <li>500g lamb mince or if you prefer something not so silent, we suggest beef
        <li>2 garlic cloves, crushed, not merely defeated
        <li>1 tsp mixed spice, who was added to the group after Posh Spice left Ginger Spice, Sporty Spice, Scary Spice, and Baby Spice to fend for themselves
        <li>500g carton passata if Tomato purée is not found in your upper-middle class grocery store
        <li>2 aubergines, cut into slices or 2 eggplats cut into sheets or 2 brinjals cut into circles
        <li>300ml tub crème fraîche, not to be confused with the sour cream eaten by mortals
        <li>140g cheddar, which is to be avoided if you dislike love handles
            
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Steps</h3>    

    <ol>
        <li>take the meaty ingredients</li>
        <li>put them in a bowl with the taste giving ingredients</li>
        <li>mix 'em</li>
        <li>fry 'em</li>
        <li>don't over-boil the potatoes</li>
        <li>the potatoes should for all intents and purposes be put into the shape of sheets, circles or slices</li>
        <li>make a layered cake with meat and potato&eggplant sheets, circles or slices, and stuff with creme</li>
        <li>bake the monstrosity in a sizzling hot electric box, although you my opt for a gas oven, but we have found this to be distressing for some Europeans also</li>
        <li>cover the cake with cheesy and garnishy stuff</li>
    </ol>
