    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Do you like high blood-sugar levels? Do you like layered stuff, like your non-existant designer boyfriend's .psd file? Do you like to pretend to like the simpler things in life so your highschool drop-out friends think you are 79% more #DownWithTheThugLife than you would have them believe? Then Tiramisu is the choice for you (rhyme sold separately) -- Enjoy this sugar infested layery goodnessed some refer to as dessert topped with unrefined caffeine particles for everyone in need of an extra kick.</p> 

    <p><strong>BEWARE</strong>: <em>Tiramisu has been found to be a mild diuretic</em>, causing sensations similar to those experienced by manbun wielding males, who simultaneously indulge in homebrew mocca concotions early in the morning. A smart housewife called Nancy has found that switching back to drip-coffee like a normal human individuum reduces most enumerated symptoms. No cure for people living outside of 200 km radius from the defacto border of Italy and still indulging in tiramisu have been found. </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>568ml pot double cream, because such are the precise science-grade measurements Italians are renowned for 
        <li>250g tub mascarpone if any is left after you keep trying it if it tastes more like whipped cream or more like butter
        <li>75ml marsala if you are bothered to Google what this actually means
        <li>5 tbsp golden caster sugar, but if you were cursed to live outside Buckingham Palace, you will opt for white sugar like us plebs usually do
        <li>300ml strong coffee, made with 2 tbsp coffee granules and 300ml boiling water, if you fail to comply with this demands, the Ministero degli Measurementi d'Italia will file an international warrant for immediate arrest
        <li>175g pack sponge fingers, simply because real fingers are often illegal or just plain hard to find
        <li>25g dark-side chocolate
        <li>2 tsp cocoa powder, because we have found gunpowder to be incompatible with birthday candles

            
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>    

    <ol>
        <li>take the creamy ingredients</li>
        <li>put them in a bowl with the marsala thingy and whip it, whipt it good<li>mix 'em</li>
        <li>put the legal variety of spongy fingers in a pan and drown them with coffee</li>
        <li>spread the produced murder scene with cream and further hide the evidence with StarWars chocolate</li>
        <li>the potatoes should for all intents and purposes be put into the shape of sheets, circles or slices</li>
        <li>loop the last three steps producing layers until ingrediens are in abundance</li>
        <li>put the tower of sugar, cream and coffee into a cold box and take a chill pill overnight</li>
        <li>dust the house before serving and only then proceed to dusting the cake with non-combustable cocoa powder</li>
        <li>there is no gas oven needed in the preparation of this dish, but gas stoves might be present in the pocess</li>
    </ol>
